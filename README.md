# Labsylle
A cool word puzzle game I made in a short time! I can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and see if there's anything that may prove useful to you.

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/labsylle-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://raewtf.itch.io/labsylle) (PC), and [here](https://play.date/games/labsylle) (Playdate). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, compress the contents of `source/` and use `love` to run the program (PC), or use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder (Playdate), and enjoy! (Note that in the Playdate version, scoreboard functions won't work properly when building from source — for proper leaderboard support, please consider buying the game in Catalog!)
