A cool word puzzle game I made in a short time! I can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and see if there's anything that may prove useful to you.

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/labsylle-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://raewtf.itch.io/labsylle). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy!
